# App.module.css 
means all the styles will be only applied to app and not overwrite.

# styles
for className="container" we can always write as {style.conatiner} makes sure you dont have any interference with any other css file.

# async-await
deals with promises same as .then returns promise and awaits tell to async the functn (execute synchronus lines first then this one.)

# count-up
react-countUp library is used to show number in a counting format.

# classnames
while using module.css you cant give two classnames for styling so need to import this library and use as
{cx(styles.test,style.test1)}
